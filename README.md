# project-440
Sure,   A simple blog platform that allows users to post and share code snippets. Built with Express and React, and uses GitHub Gists to store code.  To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies. Then run the blog locally with `npm run server`. The blog will then be accessible at http://localhost:5000.  I hope this is helpful!

                <p class="covidText">According to a recent study published in a leading medical journal, the COVID-19 <br>
                vaccine has been found to be highly effective in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years <br> old. The study, which involved over 2,000 participants, showed that the vaccine <br> produced a strong immune response and was well-tolerated by the adolescents. <br> <br>
            This news is particularly important as schools and other educational institutions <br>prepare to resume in-person activities. With the vaccine proving to be effective in <br> adolescents, it offers a glimmer of hope in the fight against the pandemic. Health <br>experts urge parents to consider gettting their adolescent children vaccinated as <br>soon as possible to help protect them from COVID-19. <br> <br>
The education sector in Nigeria has been greatly impacted by the COVID-19 <br>pandemic, with schools being shut down for extended periods of time. The lack of <br>access to quality education has been a major concern for parents and educators alike. <br> <br>
In addition, the pandemic has exposed the existing challenges in the education <br>sector such as inadequate infrastructure, inadequate funding, and the shortage of <br>
qualified teachers. These issues have been further excerbated by the pandemic, <br> making it even more difficult to provide quality education to students. <br> <br>
The Nigerian government has taken steps to address these challenges, such as the <br> launch of the Nation Home Grown School Feeding Program, which aims to provide <br>
school meals to millions of chilfren across the country. However, more needs to be <br> done to < ensure that all children have access to quality education, even in the midst <br>
of a pandemic. It is crucial for stakeholders in the education sector to come together <br> to find innovative solutions to these challenges.</p>
